<p><b> BIO </b></p>
<p>
 I received the Ing. HES (B.Sc.) degree in telecommunications from the
<a href="http://www.eif.ch" target="_blank">University of Applied
Sciences Fribourg</a>, Switzerland in 2001. In 2005, I received the
Master of Science degree in <a href="https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/electrical-software"
target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> from the <a
href="http://www.ucalgary.ca" target="_blank">University of
Calgary</a>, Canada for my thesis on 'Compensating susceptibility
difference artifacts produced by metallic implants in magnetic
resonance imaging'. I completed my PhD in 2012 at the University of Calgary
working on image analysis of high-resolution computed tomography
images of bones with <a href="https://ucalgary.ca/people/steven-boyd">Dr Steven Boyd</a> and Dr Ed Vigmond in the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca/labs/bonelab/home" target="_blank">Bone Imaging Lab</a>. From March 2012 to May 2013, I was a  CIHR Post Doctoral Fellow in Musculoskeletal Health Research< at the <a
href="http://www.imaging.robarts.ca/">Robarts Research Institute</a>,
working with <a
href="https://www.robarts.ca/research/scientists/holdsworth_david.html">Dr David
Holdsworth</a> and <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/fhs/pt/about/faculty/birmingham_t.html">Dr Trevor Birmingham</a> on methods for image-based finite-element modeling of musculoskeletal systems.
From 2013 to 2016 I held an Assistant Professor position at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences ZHAW <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/">Institute of Applied Information Technology</a>. I co-founded the <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/human-centered-computing/visual-computing/">Visual Computing Laboratory</a>.
</p>
<p>
I joined the <a href="http://www.mccaiginstitute.com">McCaig Institute for Bone and Joint Health</a> in March 2016 in the role of Scientific Manager of the Centre for Mobility and Joint Health (MoJo). From September to December 2019 I was a Research Scientist at the Institute, while teaching Python for Data Engineering as a Sessional Instructor in Software Engineering.
</p>

<p>
I am currently an Instructor in the <a
href="https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/electrical-computer">Department of
Electrical and Software Engineering</a> teaching programming using
Python and Java and machine learning.
